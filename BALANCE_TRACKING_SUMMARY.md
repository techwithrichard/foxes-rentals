# Balance-First Payment Processing System

## Core Principle: Balance is Always King ðŸ‘‘

The system now prioritizes **balance accuracy** above all else. Whether tenants pay once, multiple times, or any combination, the balance is always calculated correctly and tracked precisely.

## Key Features

### 1. **Balance-First Logic**
- **Single Payment**: If tenant pays exact amount â†’ Invoice marked as PAID
- **Multiple Payments**: If tenant pays 400, 200, 50 â†’ Each reduces balance until PAID
- **Overpayment**: Only when total payments exceed required amount â†’ Split into invoice completion + overpayment

### 2. **Smart Payment Processing**
- **Exact Match**: Payment = Remaining Balance â†’ Complete invoice
- **Partial Payment**: Payment < Remaining Balance â†’ Reduce balance
- **Overpayment**: Payment > Remaining Balance â†’ Split payment

### 3. **Comprehensive Logging**
Every payment includes detailed balance information:
- Total invoice amount
- Current paid amount
- Remaining balance before payment
- Payment amount
- New balance after payment
- Overpayment amount (if any)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Payment (Perfect Balance)
**Invoice**: Lease ID "CsBvzmgAmM" - Ksh 1,000
- Tenant pays Ksh 1,000 â†’ Balance: Ksh 0 â†’ Invoice: PAID âœ…

### Scenario 2: Multiple Partial Payments (Balance Tracking)
**Invoice**: Lease ID "CsBvzmgAmM" - Ksh 1,000
- Payment 1: Ksh 400 â†’ Balance: Ksh 600 (PARTIALLY_PAID)
- Payment 2: Ksh 200 â†’ Balance: Ksh 400 (PARTIALLY_PAID)
- Payment 3: Ksh 50 â†’ Balance: Ksh 350 (PARTIALLY_PAID)
- Payment 4: Ksh 350 â†’ Balance: Ksh 0 â†’ Invoice: PAID âœ…

### Scenario 3: Overpayment Detection (Balance Exceeded)
**Invoice**: Lease ID "CsBvzmgAmM" - Ksh 1,000
- Payment 1: Ksh 400 â†’ Balance: Ksh 600 (PARTIALLY_PAID)
- Payment 2: Ksh 200 â†’ Balance: Ksh 400 (PARTIALLY_PAID)
- Payment 3: Ksh 500 â†’ **OVERPAYMENT DETECTED!**
  - Payment split: Ksh 400 for invoice completion, Ksh 100 as overpayment
  - Invoice: PAID âœ…
  - Overpayment: Ksh 100 recorded for tenant

### Scenario 4: Your Original Example (Duplicate Prevention)
**Invoice**: Lease ID "CsBvzmgAmM" - Ksh 2,000
- Payment 1: Ksh 2,000 â†’ Balance: Ksh 0 â†’ Invoice: PAID âœ…
- Payment 2: Ksh 2,000 â†’ **OVERPAYMENT DETECTED!**
  - Payment split: Ksh 0 for invoice (already paid), Ksh 2,000 as overpayment
  - Overpayment: Ksh 2,000 recorded for tenant

## Technical Implementation

### Balance Calculation Formula
```
Total Invoice Amount = Invoice Amount + Bills Amount
Current Balance = Total Invoice Amount - Paid Amount
Overpayment = Payment Amount - Current Balance (when Payment > Balance)
```

### Payment Processing Logic
1. **Calculate Current Balance**: Total - Paid Amount
2. **Compare with Payment**: Payment vs Current Balance
3. **Apply Payment**: Update invoice with payment amount
4. **Check for Overpayment**: If Paid Amount > Total Amount
5. **Create Overpayment Record**: If overpayment detected

### Database Records Created
- **Payment Record**: Always created with detailed balance information
- **Invoice Update**: Balance and status updated
- **Overpayment Record**: Created only when overpayment occurs

## Testing Commands

### Test Balance Tracking
```bash
php artisan test:duplicate-payment 254712345678 2000
```

This will show:
- Current invoice balance
- Payment amount
- Whether it's exact match, partial payment, or overpayment
- How the payment would be processed
