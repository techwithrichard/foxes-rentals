## Performance Recommendations

### üî• High Priority (Immediate Action Required)

1. **Optimize API Response Times**
   - Current: 2-3 seconds
   - Target: < 1 second
   - Actions: Enable OPcache, optimize database queries, implement caching

2. **Enable OPcache**
   - PHP OPcache is not enabled
   - Expected improvement: 30-50% faster response times
   - Configuration needed in php.ini

3. **Implement Redis Caching**
   - Replace file-based cache with Redis
   - Expected improvement: 20-30% faster cache operations
   - Better scalability for production

### üöÄ Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

4. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Review and optimize slow queries
   - Add missing indexes for frequently queried columns
   - Implement query result caching

5. **Enable Laravel Optimizations**
   - Route caching: `php artisan route:cache`
   - View caching: `php artisan view:cache`
   - Config caching: `php artisan config:cache`

6. **Asset Optimization**
   - Minify CSS and JavaScript files
   - Enable gzip compression
   - Optimize images (use WebP format)

### üìà Low Priority (Future Improvements)

7. **CDN Implementation**
   - Use Content Delivery Network for static assets
   - Reduce server load and improve global performance

8. **Database Scaling**
   - Consider read replicas for read-heavy operations
   - Implement connection pooling

9. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement application performance monitoring (APM)
   - Set up alerts for performance degradation
